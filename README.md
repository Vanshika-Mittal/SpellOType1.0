# SpellOType1.0
Scratch code for SpellOType 1.0


* Spell'O'type is a creation of love from a young teenager for her sister. Vanshika Mittal put together her skills and passion for coding, to make this program for her sister with special needs. She chose to share it with her sisterâ€™s school mates who all attend a special school program at Samatha Learning Center, Bangalore, India.

* This program is a brilliant and friendly way to introduce typing to children who would one day use this as a mode of communication. As they learn to find the keys on the keypad of the laptop and computer, children learn to spell words. The letters are sounded out as they type and the whole word is called out when completed. Then a picture appears to reinforce the vocabulary. Children love the accolade they receive after every word! The best part is that there is no acknowledgement for a wrong letter typed. The program goes forward only when the right letter is typed.

* Kudos to Vanshika for rolling so many skills into one program. Waiting for more exciting programs to take form with this creative and caring mind at work. For any support please connect with **spellotype@gmail.com**
